    <div class="row text-left">
        <p>Hello and welcome to our tiny paradise! Our collaborative team of lifestyle & destination photographers is headed by Siddharth Krish and based in the US Virgin Islands.  Our style of imagery is unique as we strive to marinate vivid Caribbean colors with a hint of romantic fine art.  We are available for assignments in the Virgin Islands and tropical destinations worldwide.</p>
        <p><b>MEET SID</b></p>
        <p>At the young age of 16, my biology teacher handed me his fully mechanical Nikon FM camera during a field trip, (I think in the hopes of keeping me out of trouble) and immediately I fell in love with photography.</p>
        <p>Since then, I have been fortunate enough to travel all over the world on photo assignments, capturing beauty in all forms and cultures.  I love free diving, traveling, making people laugh and chilling with my puppies and amazing wife. </p>
        <p>My favorite photography assignments are documenting tropical, luxury weddings, Love for Water assignments and pristine tropical lifestyle.  I feel incredibly blessed that my talent allows me an opportunity to make humans feel beautiful.</p>

        <p><b>MEET LARA</b><br><br>As the daughter of a travelling diplomat, my childhood was filled with memories of living in three of the most cosmopolitan & art driven cities in the world; Singapore, London & New York.</p>
        <p>These memories would later become the driving influential factor that would force me to exit my successful health profession and dive head first into the artistic world of photography.  I love arranging travel plans to places that most people have never heard, throwing spontaneous dinner parties where I am the chef & host and waking up at any hour to read up on the latest fashion trends.</p>
        <p>When I am not shooting or editing thousands of images, I am busy creating customized South Sea pearl necklaces for my jewelry company LA-RA.</p>

        <p><b>MEET ALEX</b><br><br>After graduating from Ringling College of Art & Design, I moved back to my home in the Virgin Islands where I trained rigorously with Sid & Lara for two years.</p>
        <p>I love shooting beach weddings, family portraits & tropical landscapes.  When I am not researching the latest trends in photography or social media, you can find me at beach soaking up the Caribbean sun with my dog or sharing laughs at my familyâ€™s home with an ice cold Heineken in hand.</p>
        <p>My dream is to work as hard as possible to master the art of photography and simply make people feel genuine & lovely.</p>

        <p><b><br>WE MAKE DREAMS TURN REALITY. TRY US!<br>TRUSTED OVER 20 YEARS</b></p>
